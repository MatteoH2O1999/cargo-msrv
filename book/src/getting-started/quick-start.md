### ⏱️ Quick start

If all you want to do is find the MSRV for your package, you can run:

```shell
cargo msrv find
```

This command will attempt to determine the MSRV by doing a binary search on
acceptable Rust releases. If you require additional options, please refer to the
[`cargo-msrv commands`] section, or run `cargo msrv help` to view the program's help
output.
